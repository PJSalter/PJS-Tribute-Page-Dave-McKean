                <h3>Bio on Dave Mckean</h3>
                <p>
                    Dave Mckean was <b>born</b> on the <i>29<sup>th</sup> of December 1963,</i> in a town called <b>Tablow</b> in <b>Berkshire.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Dave has worked in a number of creative fields from Illustration, collage, film-Making, 
                    photography, comic book artist, Graphic Designer. However he started his career as an Illustrator once he studied 
                    a the <b>Berkshire college of Art and Design</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Mckean has worked on a variety of projects, many of these he collaborated with long time friend and book writer Neil Gaiman. 
                    They met in the year <i>1986</i> such as <strong>Mr Punch</strong> in <i>1975</i> and even did the very intriguing art
                    for The famous covers of <strong>The Sandman</strong> graphic novels collection which are by far one of my favourite
                    stories to read of all time.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the most successful Graphic Novels that he Illustrated for was <strong> Arkham Asylum </strong> which was a Batman storyline written by the 
                    famous <strong><em>Grant Morrison</em></strong> This was a great tale created and produced in <i>1989.</i> Then during <i>1995</i> the project 
                    ventured into a collaboration with <em><strong> Rolling Stones </strong></em> and <em><strong> Vertigo.</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    He has contributed many illustrations for films like <b>Blade</b> that starred <strong><em>Wesley Snipes</em>. <em>Tim Burton's </em> Sleepy Hollow </strong> and <strong>Alien Resurrection.</strong> as well 
                    as worked on several childrens books that were written by Neil Gaiman like <strong>The Wolves in the Walls</strong> which is a New York Times 
                    Illustrated Book of the Year and <strong>MirrorMask.</strong> He's also gained a lot of awards over the years such as the Ignatz Award, 
                    the International Alph Art award and Italy’s La Pantera Award. and the Harvey Award for Best new comic and best graphic novel on his comic Novel <b>Cages</b>. Hes done
                    drawings for adult books such as <strong> Night Shift</strong><em><b> by Stephen King</b></em> and <strong> Coraline, The Graveyard Book</strong><em><b> by Neil Gaiman.</b></em><br>
                    <br>
                    During <i>1998</i> Dave has also been involved in making films which were short films called <strong> n[eon] </strong> and <strong> The Week Before </strong> and played them 
                    worldwide, also won and award in a <em>First Prize Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival.</em> This definately caught <strong><em>Lisa Hensons</em></strong> eye from the <strong><em>Jim Henson Company.</em></strong> and 
                    pushed Dave to use his film crew and Neil Gaiman to to on the film adaptation <b>MirrorMask</b> for <b>Columbia/Tristar</b> as a fantasy 
                    movie. <br>
                    <br>
                    Dave keeps himself very busy till today with projects on drawings that inspire him of Erotic Cinema for a book that 
                    is titled <strong> Caustic </strong> and has worked on <em><strong>Stephen Kings Colorado Kid</strong></em> and

                    give power toward the silent cinema and working on two new Graphic Novels called <b> Caligaro </b> and <b> Raptor. </b> To this 
                    present day he has been living with his wife named <em><strong> Clare </strong></em> who has a career as a Studio Manager and Musician.

                <q>The reason I love comics is that they DON'T move, and there is NO sound. As a creator I have to evoke those elements 
                in the drawings and writing, and the reader has to create those elements in their own minds.</q>
