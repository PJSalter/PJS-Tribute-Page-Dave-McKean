### About:

I was tasked by Founders and Coders to create a Tribute Website that shows my skills I have learnt from freeCodeCamp on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This website provides information on Dave Mckean :artist: an artist that I truly admire. His work is super fascinating, from mixed media of photographic and painted surreal characters. :art:

### Completed Features:

- :strawberry: Semantic HTML.
- :pineapple: CSS Grid.
- :grapes: CSS Flex.
- :melon: The page has a title, or heading, at the top of the page.
- :tomato: The page contains several images of Dave Mckeans art work.
- :peach: Elements have styles such as background colours, borders, margins and padding.
- :green_apple: Some pieces of text have emphasis such as bold or italics.
- :lemon: A user can click on a link that takes them Dave Mckeans personal bio website explaining the life and how he originated his style.
- :tangerine: The page has a list explaining all my top favourite lists of his greatest work.
- :cherries: Everything on the page fits on any screen sizes with a responsive design, without content overflowing or being cut off using several Media queries.
